#### Forward Model
(Physical) model of the head tissue and conductivity, used to compute sensor/external activity based on source/internal activity.

#### Lead field matrix
The mathematical representation of the forward model, i.e. a matrix that is applied to source activity to yield the associated sensor activity.
